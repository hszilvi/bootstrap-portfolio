## My_process
I recreated the layout was given using Bootstrap. I used Bootstrap's in-built styles.

I used HTML, Bootstrap and a little CSS to make the website work and meet all the layout criterias. I learned how to use Bootstrap docs to recreate the portfolio website. 

I wrote the readme.md with the relative path to screen shot and links and other expected contents. 

### Built_with
HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, VS code

## What_I_learned
I learned a lot about Bootstrap. I have a good understanding in using the Bootstrap grid system and components. 

### Continued_developement
- I still need to learn more about Bootstrap.
- need to practise more CSS.
