# bootstrap-portfolio


## 1. Bootstrap Portfolio Challenge (180 mins)

### 1.1 Instructor Demo: Introduce Challenge (15 min)

* During this week's challenge, students will use their new Bootstrap skills to recreate their portfolio

* Students should take this time to get creative with their customizations and to keep in mind their User Funnel when recreating their portfolio.

* There is no starter code this week. Students should use their portfolio from the previous unit.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What are we learning?

  * üôã We are learning to use Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS to recreate a portfolio site.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this project build off or extend previously learned material?
  
  * üôã We will use all of our knowledge to date. How to customize Bootstrap, the 12-column grid system, and our previous knowledge of HTML and CSS!
  
  * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this project relate to your career goals?
  
  * üôã As a developer, you need a place to showcase your work to potential employers. Let your work do the talking for you!

* Ask TAs to direct students to the Challenge Requirements found in `challenge/README.md`.

### 1.2 Student Do: Challenge (150 mins)

In this assignment, you'll be building your portfolio layout using the Bootstrap CSS Framework.

## Before You Begin

* You've learned a ton of material: HTML, CSS, GitHub, GitHub Pages, and Bootstrap. If you feel like you're falling behind, there's no need to panic. You'll have plenty of time to digest and master this material.

* We're diving into JavaScript next unit, and HTML/CSS will start receiving less focus. Still, you'll find that a basic knowledge of HTML/CSS will help you understand JavaScript, especially when we use it to manipulate web pages.

## Commits

* Having an active and healthy commit history on GitHub is important for your future job search. It is also extremely important for making sure your work is saved in your repository. If something breaks, committing often ensures you are able to go back to a working version of your code.

* Committing often is a signal to employers that you are actively working on your code and learning.

  * We use the mantra ‚Äúcommit early and often.‚Äù  This means that when you write code that works, add it and commit it!

  * Numerous commits allow you to see how your app is progressing and give you a point to revert to if anything goes wrong.

* Be clear and descriptive in your commit messaging.

  * When writing a commit message, avoid vague messages like "fixed." Be descriptive so that you and anyone else looking at your repository knows what happened with each commit.

* We would like you to have well over 200 commits by graduation, so commit early and often!
